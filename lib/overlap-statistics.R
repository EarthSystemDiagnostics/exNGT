#' Calculate standard error
#'
#' Calculate the standard error of a data vector, i.e. its standard deviation
#' divided by the square root of the number of data points.
#'
#' @param x numeric vector for which to calculate the standard error.
#' @param na.rm a logical value indicating whether \code{NA} values should be
#'   stripped before the computation proceeds.
#' @return the standard error of \code{x}.

#' Statistics of the overlap period
#'
#' Deliver the statistics of the overlap period between the old and the
#' new (re-drilled) isotope record at a certain site.
#'
#' @param data data frame with the NGT and associated oxygen isotope records.
#' @param site character string of the site ID for which to calculate the
#'   overlap statistics; must match the list of sites for which re-drilled
#'   records are available.
#' @return a nested list with two elements:
#'   * "dat": a list of two data frames with the full data for the paired
#'     records at the requested site and the data for the overlap period.
#'   * "stat": a list of six elements with statistical information about the
#'     records' overlap; including start and end year of overlap period, mean
#'     isotope values in the overlap period, the difference of these mean
#'     values, the correlation for the overlap period, and the standard error of
#'     the mean values in the overlap period.
